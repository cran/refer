Title: Create Object References
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Christopher Mann <cmann3@unl.edu>
Maintainer: Christopher Mann <cmann3@unl.edu>
Description: Allows users to easily create references to R objects then
    'dereference' when needed or modify in place without using reference 
    classes, environments, or active bindings as workarounds. Users can 
    also create expression references that allow subsets of any object to 
    be referenced or expressions containing references to multiple 
    objects.
